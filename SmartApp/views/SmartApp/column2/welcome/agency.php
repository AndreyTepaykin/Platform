		<h3 id="about">Interactive Marketing Agencies</h3>

		<p>
			Q was designed and built by industry veterans who spent many years
			designing social media campaigns, facebook apps, and interactive experiences.
			When it comes to building a new campaign, we know that quick turnaround,
			flexibility and reliability are essential.

	<ul class="SmartApp-items">
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Separation of concerns</span>:
			Q is built to enable teams to work together. For example, have your designers create the themes first,
			and when you kick off your project, the developers can build the back end support to make the app work.
			Since all Qbix apps have a common structure, system admins and testers have an easier time, too.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Re-use building blocks</span>:
			Get projects done faster by re-using stuff built in earlier projects. Often, demos can
			be thrown together in short order by placing a few self-contained <span class="literal">tools</span>
			on custom-designed <span class="literal">pages</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Flexibility</span>:
			Almost everything in Qbix is overridable, and it can easily interoperate with other platforms and libraries.
			Whether it's back-end or front-end APIs, Qbix is designed to play nice with others.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Reward your users</span>: Qbix comes with plugins such as
			<span class="literal">Awards</span>, which supports badges, leaderboards and credits right out of the box.
			Integrate with any payment processor, such as Stripe.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Scalable</span>:
			Unlike other web platforms, Qbix is ready to handle the day your campaign goes viral.
			The database layer in Qbix is designed help developers build schemas that smoothly scale with
			increasing load, while still maintaining 99.99% uptime.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Be where the users are</span>: Qbix handles all the details
			of integrating with email, facebook, and even mobile phones. We've had to tackle
			lots of architectural and security implications, so you don't have to.
			<a class="SmartApp-login" href="#login">Try it yourself.</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Viral invitations</span>: Don't simply rely
			on word of mouth. Let people invite each other through SMS, email and facebook,
			taking advantage of our <em>one-step invitation system</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Increase engagement</span>: When you build an app that lets
			people collaborate from any device, they will find their own reasons to engage with your app
			more frequently and meaningfully.
		</li>
	<li>
		<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Measure and optimize</span>: Rather having to guess how your app is doing,
		use Q's <span class="literal">Metrics</span> plugin built specifically to measure virality and engagement.
		Use up-to-date reports to show how your campaigns are performing. Of course, you can still
		integrate Google Analytics or anything else.
