			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Separation of concerns</span>:
				Q is built to enable teams to work together. Choose your templating engine, or use the ones that come with Q
				(<a target="_blank" href="http://php.net">PHP</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>)
				and don't worry about breaking the developers' code. Design layouts, views, email templates, and more.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Multiple targets</span>:
				Apps built on Q are able to run on desktop browsers, tablets and mobile phones practically out of the box.
				Your themes will be accessed by users wherever they are. Q conventions enable you to design themes that work
				with different device orientations, properly support touch events, and more.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Dynamic interfaces</span>:
				The front end interface in Q consists of one or more virtual <span class="literal">pages</span>,
				that load dynamically yet work correctly with the back button and browser history, taking advantage of HTML5 whenever possible.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Building blocks</span>:
				Take advantage of reusable, self-contained <span class="literal">tools</span>
				that anyone can place on <span class="literal">pages</span>, or help build your own.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Front end scripting</span>:
				If you have some JavaScript experience, you can let your interfaces update in real-time
				by listening for messages coming from streams via <a target="_blank" href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3 id="with">How Qbix can help you</h3>
		<ul class="SmartApp-items">
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Theme marketplace</span>: After designing and polishing your themes,
				you can package and sell them on our marketplace. Or give them away for free. Either way, when
				an app developer uses your theme, your work and your brand will get a lot of exposure.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Our community</span>:
				We are currently in the process of growing our developer community. If you feel you can
				contribute, by all means <?php echo Q_Html::a("SmartApp/community") ?>join us</a>!
