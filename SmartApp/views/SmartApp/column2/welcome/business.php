			Use Qbix to build a social app, or even turn your existing applications into social apps.
			If you have an app that people use to do X, Qbix will let you:
		</p>
		<ul class="SmartApp-items">
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Sign up users anywhere</span>: Qbix handles all the details
				of user signup, either with email, mobile number, or facebook. We've thought through
				lots of architectural and security implications, and the result "just works".
				<a class="SmartApp-login" href="#login">Try it yourself.</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Viral invitations</span>: Don't simply rely
				on word of mouth. Let people invite each other through SMS, email and facebook,
				taking advantage of our <em>one-step invitation system</em>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Increase engagement</span>: When you build an app that lets
				people collaborate from any device, they will find their own reasons to engage with your app
				more frequently and meaningfully.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Reward your users</span>: Balance incentives and monetize your app
				using Q's <span class="literal">Awards</span> plugin, which powers badges, credits and more.
				Integrate with any payment processor, such as Stripe.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="SmartApp-item-title">Measure and optimize</span>: Rather having to guess how your app is doing,
				use Q's <span class="literal">Metrics</span> plugin built specifically to measure virality and engagement.
				Use up-to-date reports in your meetings to plan your strategy. Of course, you can still
				integrate Google Analytics or anything else.
			</li>
			
		</ul>
