		Over 60% of mobile phone users now use internet-enabled smartphones.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/06/smartphones-61-percent/">1</a></sup>
		You need to reach them where they are.

		No &mdash; more than that &mdash; you should <em>empower</em> people
		to use your app in ways that take advantage of their new devices,
		while respecting their privacy and protecting them from information overload.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q lets you get it right. It's a modular platform that provides a lot
		right out of the box, and can be easily extended with new functionality.
